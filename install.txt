How to install
==============

1) Install a Python 3 compiler (e.g. Nuitka, WinPython, PyInstaller, etc.)

2) Compile (the Python version is 3.6)

3) Move to your programs folder:

  - On Linux and some other UNIX-like systems, this should be '/usr/bin/'

  - On Windows, Wine and ReactOS, this should be "C:\Windows\Helios Compass"

  - On macOS (formerly Mac OS X), this should be "/Applications"

4) If on a Windows PC, you will need to make an association to the program in the system registry

  1) Go to Computer --> System Properties (or Win + Break) --> Advanced System Settings

  2) Click the Environment Variables link (it's in the 'Advanced' tab)

  3) Edit the PATH variable and add "C:\Windows\Helios Compass" to the end

  4) Click "OK"
